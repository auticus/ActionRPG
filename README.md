# ActionRPG
 A unity action RPG game.  This project is a learning / demo for me to learn my way around Unity based off of a GameDev.tv course:  https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-rpg

It is essentially pulling from Diablo or Path of Exiles for its mechanics and is only the combat mechanics portion.

This project uses Synty low-poly assets.  The levels in this project are not professional quality, they were done to get the project done and experiment with some of Unity's
features.
